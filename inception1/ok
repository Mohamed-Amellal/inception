The network line must be present in your docker-compose.yml file
It is mandatory to use environment variables.
Also, it is strongly recommended to use a .env file to store
environment variables. The .env file should be located at the root
of the srcs directory
Your NGINX container must be the only entrypoint into your
infrastructure via the port 443 only, using the TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3
protocol.
For obvious security reasons, any credentials, API keys, env
variables etc... must be saved locally in a .env file and ignored by
git. Publicly stored credentials will lead you directly to a failure
of the project.
